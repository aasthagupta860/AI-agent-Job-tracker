# ðŸ“Š AI Agent Job Tracker (Power BI Report)

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** built to track job postings for Data/AI-related roles.  
It demonstrates my ability to connect to APIs, clean and transform data, and design interactive visualizations for analysis.

---

## Project Overview
The **AI Agent Job Tracker** collects job postings data (from [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch/) or similar sources) and presents insights such as:
- Trends in job postings over time  
- Location-based job distribution  
- Top hiring companies  
- In-demand skills and keywords  
- Recent postings for quick reference  

This project highlights my skills in **data integration, cleaning, visualization, and dashboard design using Power BI**.

---

## Features of the Dashboard
- Dynamic filters** (by Job Ttile, location, company, posting date)  
- Interactive visuals** to drill down into specific trends  
- KPIs** summarizing key metrics like total jobs, active companies, etc.  
- Clean, professional UI** with consistent design

##  How to View the Report
Since **Power BI Desktop is Windows-only**, I have provided multiple ways to view this project:

1. PDF Export** (see `job market dashboard.pdf`) â€“ view the full report without Power BI.  
2. PBIX File** (see `AI_Agent_Job_Tracker.pbix`) â€“ open in Power BI Desktop if you want to explore the live visuals.

##  Tech Stack
- Power BI Desktop** â€“ Data modeling & visualization  
- JSearch API (via RapidAPI)** â€“ Job postings data source  
- n8n (automation)** â€“ For API calls & job tracking pipeline  
- GitHub** â€“ Sharing & documentation

##  Learnings
Through this project, I practiced:
- API integration for real-world data  
- Data cleaning & transformation in Power Query  
- Building insightful dashboards in Power BI  
- Designing recruiter-friendly visual reports  

---

##  Next Steps
- Automate daily job data refresh with APIs  
- Extend analysis to multiple job portals  
- Deploy an interactive version using my own Power BI Service account

 **Note:** This project was originally built using a student Power BI account, but all files here (`.pbix`, screenshots, PDF) are accessible without requiring that account.
