# 📊 AI Agent Job Tracker (Power BI Report)

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** built to track job postings for Data/AI-related roles.  
It demonstrates my ability to connect to APIs, clean and transform data, and design interactive visualizations for analysis.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
The **AI Agent Job Tracker** collects job postings data (from [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch/) or similar sources) and presents insights such as:
- 📈 Trends in job postings over time  
- 🌍 Location-based job distribution  
- 🏢 Top hiring companies  
- 📝 In-demand skills and keywords  
- ⏳ Recent postings for quick reference  

This project highlights my skills in **data integration, cleaning, visualization, and dashboard design using Power BI**.

---

## 🔹 Features of the Dashboard
- **Dynamic filters** (by Job Ttile, location, company, posting date)  
- **Interactive visuals** to drill down into specific trends  
- **KPIs** summarizing key metrics like total jobs, active companies, etc.  
- **Clean, professional UI** with consistent design

## 🔹 How to View the Report
Since **Power BI Desktop is Windows-only**, I have provided multiple ways to view this project:

1. **PDF Export** (see `job market dashboard.pdf`) – view the full report without Power BI.  
2. **PBIX File** (see `AI_Agent_Job_Tracker.pbix`) – open in Power BI Desktop if you want to explore the live visuals.

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling & visualization  
- **JSearch API (via RapidAPI)** – Job postings data source  
- **n8n (automation)** – For API calls & job tracking pipeline  
- **GitHub** – Sharing & documentation

## 🔹 Learnings
Through this project, I practiced:
- API integration for real-world data  
- Data cleaning & transformation in Power Query  
- Building insightful dashboards in Power BI  
- Designing recruiter-friendly visual reports

## 🔹 Next Steps
- Automate daily job data refresh with APIs  
- Extend analysis to multiple job portals  
- Deploy an interactive version using my own Power BI Service account

💡 **Note:** This project was originally built using a student Power BI account, but all files here (`.pbix`, screenshots, PDF) are accessible without requiring that account.
